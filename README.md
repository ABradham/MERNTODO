# MERN Todo
This is a simple webapp for tracking To-dos, shopping lists, or anything else you can think to track.

## Purpose
This is my first time using the MERN stack (and using JavaScript at all!) so this is mainly a learning opportunity for me.

## Credits
I'm using this YouTube tutorial to help get a feel for the MERN workflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE
